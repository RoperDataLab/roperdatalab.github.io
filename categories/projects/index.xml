      <description>Help us tell the stories of Nebraskans who have died of coronavirus More than 250 Nebraskan’s have died during the pandemic, but we don’t know much about them. Every day, a health department in the state issues a press release that says a man or a woman of such and such age died.
But no more.
These people are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, friends, neighbors, members of our community.</description>
