      <description>On Monday, the Small Business Administration released the names of some 650,000 Paycheck Protection Program loans given to businesses during the pandemic. Big news organizations went into action, finding the politcally connected who got loans, interesting businesses who got them and even some irony in the data.
But for very small organizations, who don’t have data desks and investigative units, the data wasn’t particularly useful. For small town newspapers, local companies getting PPP loans is an interesting story, but most of them lack the resources to go diving into a 127 MB spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>More than 250 Nebraskan’s have died during the pandemic, but we don’t know much about them. Every day, a health department in the state issues a press release that says a man or a woman of such and such age died.
But no more.
These people are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, friends, neighbors, members of our community. And we know so little about them.
In any other time, we would have memorials to the dead.</description>

      <description>In March 2020, with campus closed along with businesses statewide, the data journalism class at UNL’s College of Journalism and Mass Communication started talking about how we could measure the impact of quarantine on daily life.
To measure the impact of the coronavirus on Nebraska, we looked for automated data collectors. One such automated data collector is the automated traffic counting stations that the data Department of Transportation uses.</description>
