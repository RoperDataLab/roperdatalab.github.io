      <description>Help us tell the stories of Nebraskans who have died of coronavirus More than 250 Nebraskan’s have died during the pandemic, but we don’t know much about them. Every day, a health department in the state issues a press release that says a man or a woman of such and such age died.
But no more.
These people are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, friends, neighbors, members of our community.</description>

      <description>Got questions? We&amp;rsquo;ve got answers.
1. WHAT IS THE ROPER LAB FOR DATA IN COMMUNITY NEWS? We&amp;rsquo;ve just launched, so some of it is still being worked out. But at it&amp;rsquo;s heart, the Roper Lab is a place for students to get experience working on real world data journalism stories while helping Nebraska&amp;rsquo;s local media get access to the tools and possibilities of data journalism for their publications. We believe fiercely that the tools that journalists in New York and Washington DC work just as well in Ainsworth and Osceola.</description>
